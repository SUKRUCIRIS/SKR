# SKR
SKR is an easy to use 2d game/application making framework for windows platform. It is a C library, so you can use it in your C/C++ projects. You can include the source files directly into your project.

SKR consists of three main parts:
1- Rendering/Window management/input part which is built on win32/direct2d.
2- A simple 2d physics engine for games.
3- I used SoLoud library for audio part of this framework. (https://github.com/jarikomppa/soloud) 

SKR framework is developed by Şükrü Çiriş (except the audio part), and uses the MIT license.

# Documentation?
I will write somethings or make some youtube videos about SKR, when I have time.
